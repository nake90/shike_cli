# shike client
Client interface for shike, a 3D cloud point generator of buildings and objects
from pictures.

## Compiling
You'll need [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) installed.
To compile place the project in the *apps/myApps/* of your openFrameworks root
folder. ( *myApps* can be any folder you like )
Then type `make` in a terminal. The executable will be placed in *bin/*, and you
execute it with `make run` or by running `cd bin/ && ./shike_cli`.
To build the debug version use `make Debug` instead.
